# Study Jams: Android For Beginners

The [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/groups/) Study Jams is a free series of global, community-run, in-person study groups. The [first Study Jams series](http://developerstudyjams.com/) ran in 2015 in partnership with Udacity, and focused on their [Android Fundamentals curriculum](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud853) targeting participants with some coding background.


## About This Jam
Based on insights from that first run, the second series of Study Jams in 2016 will run from Feb-May and focus on the [Udacity "Android for Beginners"](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud837) curriculum. This version targets absolute beginners -- anyone who has no programming experience, or has programmed with a language other than Android. You can find out more about the course content and materials on the [Udacity Course Wiki](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud837).

## About the GDG Hudson Valley Jam
We will kick off with an [all-day workshop](http://www.meetup.com/gdg-hudson-valley/events/227448769/) where we will review all lesson content, ensure that everyone is setup with the right development environment for the course, and walk everyone through at least one simple practice set.

The six lessons will then be covered over the next 4-6 weeks based on a combination of self-study (review content on your own) and group-discussion (ask questions, share insights or request clarifications) using Hangouts and Slack. Anyone is welcome to join the Slack discussions - just sign up for the [GDG Hudson Valley Slack](gdghv.herokuapp.com).
